		<h3>Pecha Kucha Presentation</h3>
		<p>
			A Pecha Kucha is a short and quick presentation style that uses only images instead of words. The presenter talks on each slide for about 15 seconds, and the slideshow is about 7-10 slides long. This presentation of this project was also done in a Pecha Kucha style, and below you will find the slideshow used for this topic along with the script.

		<h3>Information</h3>
		<p>You can view the full script, image citations, and image descriptions by going to the speaker notes (Options, Open speaker notes).</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #1: Introduction</b>
			<p>
				English is now recognized as the global language with over a billion speakers. But it wasn’t always this way. It actually started out as a small Germanic dialect of the Anglo-Saxon in the 5th century, and changed a lot over the next 1,500 years.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #2: Anglo-Saxon</b>
			<p>
				Starting in 449, three Germanic tribes from northern Europe crossed the North Sea and took over England. These three tribes, commonly referred to as the Anglo-Saxon, had similar dialects which eventually became the Old English.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #3: Early English</b>
			<p>
				About a hundred years later, St. Augustine came to England and introduced Christianity, which became very popular and resulted in Latin words being used in the church. Then, the Vikings invaded England in 878, giving lots of Norse words to English.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #4: Norman Conquest</b>
			<p>
				The Norman Conquest was a Norman invasion of England in 1066, led by conqueror William. This made England Frenchified, meaning it made French the dominant language. Over 10,000 French words like “pork” and “beef” were added to English after this event.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #5: Middle English</b>
			<p>
				After a war that lasted a hundred and sixteen years, English won became dominant again. But lots of things have changed, including the fact that London is now England’s new capital. But there are still a lot more changes to come.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #6: Early Modern</b>
			<p>
				Lots of things happen during Modern English. The first printing presses were set up which brought standardization in grammar and spelling. The Great Vowel Shift, a huge shift in vowel length, shortened the length of vowels and changed the pronunciation of words.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #7: Late Modern</b>
			<p>
				Many Greek, Latin, and made-up words by writers like Shakespeare were added through the English Renaissance. The Industrial Revolution in the 18th century brought the need to name new machines such as “engine” and “telephone.”
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #8: British Empire</b>
			<p>
				The language spread when the British Empire set out to create colonies all around the globe. Many new words from dialects of the colonies were added as well. The word “zombie” actually come from West Africa, where British colonies were present.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #9: English Today</b>
			<p>
				That was a lot of events and change. But English is still changing today. Many words are shortened and abbreviated as new technology like social media and texting comes out, and new words and phrases are being created in books, movies, and shows.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #10: Conclusion</b>
			<p>
				As you have seen, English isn’t just a pure British or Germanic language. Even though it started out as a Germanic language and is still rooted in it, English has been changed and affected by many different languages in the world. Maybe that’s why English was able to become a global language. Thank you.
