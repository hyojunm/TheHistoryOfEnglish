		<h3>Pecha Kucha Presentation</h3>
		<p>
			A Pecha Kucha is a short and quick presentation style that uses only images instead of words. The presenter talks on each slide for about 15 seconds, and the slideshow is about 7-10 slides long. This presentation of this project was also done in a Pecha Kucha style, and below you will find the slideshow used for this topic along with the script.

			<b>Slide #1: Introduction</b>
			<p>
				To communicate, to read, for me to be able to present this to you right now, we need a language that we all understand. That language, in this case, is English. English is a West Germanic language that has been changing ever since the Anglo-Saxons started it in the 5th century. Here is a very short summary of how it developed over the years.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #2: Anglo-Saxon</b>
			<p>
				Starting in 449, three Germanic tribes from northern Europe crossed the North Sea and took over England. These three tribes, commonly referred to as the Anglo-Saxon, had similar dialects which eventually mixed together and became the Old English.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #3: Early English</b>
			<p>
				About a hundred years after, St. Augustine came to England and introduced Christianity. This religion became popular and many Latin words were added to be used in the church. Then, the Vikings invaded England in 878. The Norse-speaking tribe gave a lot of words to English like the word “drag.”
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #4: Norman Conquest</b>
			<p>
				The Norman Conquest of England in 1066, led by William the Conqueror, made England Frenchified, meaning it made French the dominant language in all things. Over 10,000 French words like “pork” and “beef” were added to English after this event.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #5: Middle English</b>
			<p>
				After the Hundred Years’ War, English became dominant again, but lots of things have changed—the language has been affected by French, and London has become the new capital of England. But there are still a lot more changes to come as we enter the Modern English period.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #6: Early Modern</b>
			<p>
				Lots of things happen during Modern English. The first printing presses were set up which made printing easier and brought standardization in grammar and spelling. The Great Vowel Shift, a huge shift in vowel length, shortened the length of vowels and changed the pronunciation of words.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #7: Late Modern</b>
			<p>
				Following these were another mass of events. Through the English Renaissance, many Greek, Latin, and made-up words by writers such as Shakespeare were added. The Industrial Revolution in the 18th century brought up the need to name new technology and machines such as “engine,” “telephone,” or “electricity.” 
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #8: British Empire</b>
			<p>
				When the British Empire started to set out and create colonies all over the world in the 17th century, the language spread. Many new words from dialects of the colonies were added as well. For example, words like “zombie” come from West Africa, where British colonies were present.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #9: English Today</b>
			<p>
				Well, that was a lot of events going on there. But as some of you might know, English is still changing through lots of more events. Many words are shortened and abbreviated as new technology like social media and texting comes out, and new words and phrases are being created in books, movies, and shows.
			</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Slide #10: Conclusion</b>
			<p>
				As you have seen, English isn’t just a pure British or Germanic language. Even though it started out as a Germanic language and is still rooted in it, English has been changed and affected by many different languages in the world. Maybe that is why English was able to become a global language. Thank you.
