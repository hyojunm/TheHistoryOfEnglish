			We use English almost every single day without really thinking much about it. But have you ever wondered where English came from? English started out in the 5th century when three Germanic tribes invaded England. Their dialects combined to become the Anglo-Saxon or the Old English. From then, many outside influences and new inventions changed the language, and is still changing right now with lots of new words coming in each year. Outside influences include the introduction of Christianity, Viking invasions, Norman Conquest, Renaissance, and British colonies. These influences added lots of new words from other languages such as Latin, Greek, French, and Spanish into English. New inventions also played a role in the development of English too. Those inventions include the printing press, new technology, and more. These inventions helped standardize the language with grammar and punctuation, and create a need for new words.

		<h3>Old English</h3>

		<p>
			Starting in the year of 449, three West Germanic tribes — the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes — crossed the North Sea to arrive at England. They invaded the land, forcing the Romans or Celts who were living there upwards towards Wales. The three tribes, commonly referred to as the Anglo-Saxon, spoke similar dialects, which were mixed together to become the Old English.
		</p>

		<p>
			Shortly after the Anglo-Saxon invasion, the religion of Christianity was introduced by St. Augustine's arrival to England in 597. This religion became popular among people, and as a result Latin words were added to the language to be used in the church.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was not long after that the Vikings — the Norse-speaking seafareres — decided to come to the land. They attacked mostly the northern part of England, hurting the Northumbrians, or people living north of River Humber. Through this event Norse words like "drag" and "die" were added.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section" id="Section02">
		<h3>Middle English</h3>
		<p>
			The Middle English period is mostly about the Norman Conquest of England, one of the biggest events that changed the English language. William the Conqueror and his French-speaking soldiers conquered the Anglo-Saxon England in 1066. After William took over, English sort of disappeared as it got Frenchified — meaning French became the dominant langauge in most things such as courts. With more than 10,000 French words like "beef" and "pork" added, the impact of French on the English language is unforgettable.
		</p>

		<p>
			After the Hundred Years' War, a war between the Normandy and England that lasted more than a hundred years, English was able to become dominant again. But with it going through lots of changes, the language now became the Middle English. The capital of England also became London, where many other changes will occur.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section" id="Section03">
		<h3>Modern English</h3>
		<p>
			Modern English begun when William Caxton sets up the first printing press in England in 1476. As valuable manuscripts were being printed, Caxton realized a huge problem in grammar of the language — which eventually led to the fixing of it and the standardization of the language.
		</p>

		<p>
			Around the same time period, a big change was happening: The Great Vowel Shift. This shift in vowel length shortened the length of vowels and changed the pronunciation of words, sounding more like the English we use today.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the 16th century was the English Renaissance, a period of "explosion in culture." Through this lots and lots of Greek and Latin words were added, as well as some made-up words and phrases by writers during the time. One of the most famous writers during this time was Shakespeare, who invented hundreds of new words.
		</p>

		<p>
			As time passed, technology improved, leading to the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. This revolution and the new technology created the need to name them — words like "train," "telephone," "telegraph," "electricity" were named during this time after the inventor or other factors.
		</p>

		<p>
			You probably heard of the phrase, "The sun never sets on the British Empire." Starting in the 18th century, they started to set out and colonize different parts of the world, covering more than half the world with British colonies. But as they colonized, they also spread the English language too, and as a result, English was used all over the world and new words from colonies came into the language. Words like "zombie" come from the West African colonies, "jungle" from India, and more.
		</p>

	<div class="section" id="Section04">
		<h3>The 20th & 21st Centuries</h3>
		<p>
			In the past 1,500 years, English has gone through lots and lots of change, brought by different countries, inventions, and events to become the world's most spoken language in the world. But the language is still changing right now, with hundreds of new words and phrases coming into the language through many sources such as social media, books, movies, TV shows, animations, and more.
